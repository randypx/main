By: `Team W14-B1`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the TeachConnect data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores TeachConnect data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save TeachConnect data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of TeachConnect (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of TeachConnect before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in TeachConnect. The current state of TeachConnect is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore TeachConnect to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores TeachConnect to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies TeachConnect (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import Contacts
==== Current Implementation
The ImportCommand uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` to generate a temporary `AddressBook` object from a given path. It takes in a String value path. The command then adds the contacts or the classes found in the temporary `AddressBook` object into the main address book object. Below is the rough idea of the constructor for the class:
[source,java]
public ImportCommand(String importPath) {
        requireNonNull(importPath);
        this.filePath = importPath;
        addressBookStorage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(filePath);
}

image::ImportCommandFlowChart.png[align="center"]

Import command extends `Undoable Command` and hence Undo can be called on it. It initially checks if the given file path is valid and if so initialises the contacts from there, creates a `Person` object and adds it to the current `TeachConnect` with the help of `model`.For importing classes class objects are first created and students related to the classes are stored before being added to the model. The code can be found below.
[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
     peopleToBeImported(people);
     studentToBeImported(students);
     classesToBeImported(students, classes);

     return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Import Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only import from an `XML` file.
** Pros: Goes well with the idea of TeachConnect. Easier to implement and also clear distinction of the file that needs to be imported by the user with the help of the .XML extension.
** Cons: User might want to import from Excel only to realise this isn't possible.
* **Alternative 2:** Include import from an `Excel` file too.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user and might come in handy.
** Cons: Will not really help the user distinguish the exact file to be imported. Care has to be taken so that the input by the user follows a certain format to parse the content properly.
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export contacts
==== Current Implementation

The `ExportCommand` uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` class to generate a xml file based on a given range/index/tag and save it to the location specified with the chosen file name. It takes in String `name` String `range` Tag `tag` String `path` String `type`.It is also possible to export classes with String `path` String `name` String `type` as parameters. The tag is not compulsory and can be excluded or included depending on the user. Below is the basic idea of the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
ExportCommand(String range, Tag tag, String path, String nameOfExportFile, String type) {
        this.range = range;
        this.path = path;
        thispublic.tag = tag;
        this.nameOfExportFile = nameOfExportFile;
        this.type = type;

        teachConnectBook = new AddressBook();
}
----

image::ExportCommandDiagram.png[align="center"]

The method `handleRange()` splits the range using a separator [, in this case] and returns a `String` array with the upper bound and lower bound as values. In some cases it also returns `all` or the single `index` that has to be exported. Based on the type it also exports to an excel format or XML format.

Below is an extract of the method `handleRange()`:

[source,java]
----
public String[] handleRange() throws IOException {
        String[] rangeStringArray = this.range.split(",");
        if (rangeStringArray.length > 2) {
            throw new IOException();
        }
        return rangeStringArray;
}
----

Choosing to export classes follows a different pattern. It exports all the classes and the students related to those classes.

Any range with more than 2 values in the String array returned throws an IO Exception. To add the contacts to the export file, contacts are added to the teachConnectBook. There are 4 individual cases and multiple combinations of these:

* All (Without a tag)
** if the word `all` is present in the user input, we will just export all the contacts from the last shown list.
* All (With a Tag)
** if the word `all` is present along with a tag specified in the user input, we will just export all the contacts with that particular tag from the last shown list
* Specific index (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
** if the user input contains a specific index, we will add that index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook`.
* Range of indexes (e.g. 1,5)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by the `,` character, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook` including the lower range but excluding the upper bound.
* Range of indexes (with a tag)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by the `,` character along with the tag, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook` if that contact contains that particular tag including the lower range but excluding the upper bound.

Below is the code snippet to identify the three cases in the user input:

[source,java]
----
String[] rangeGiven;
        try {
            rangeGiven = handleRange();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_RANGE_ERROR);
        }


        try {
            handledRangeSituation = handleRangeArray(rangeGiven);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAIL);
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS);
        }

        if (handledRangeSituation != null) {
            return handledRangeSituation;
        }
        ....Storage part comes here
----

The final step is to create the xml/excel file from the `teachConnectBook`.

Below is the code snippet to export the data into an xml file using `AddressBookStorage`.
[source,java]
----
teachConnectStorage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(path + "/" + nameOfExportFile + ".xml");
        try {
            teachConnectStorage.saveAddressBook(teachConnectBook);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAIL);
        }
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
----

Depending on the type of export it can also be exported to an excel format using an arrayList called `exportAddition`.

Below is the code snipped to export the data into an excel file.
[source,java]
----
CSVPrinter csvPrinter;
       try {
            csvPrinter = csvFileToBeWritten(isClassesOrNot);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_FAIL));
            }

            if (isClassesOrNot) {
               saveAsCsvClasses(csvPrinter);
            } else {
               saveAsCsvPersons(csvPrinter);
            }

            try {
                csvPrinter.flush();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
       exceptions are to be handled...
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Export Command
* **Alternative 1:** Only export to an `XML` file.
** Pros: Easier implementation and very helpful for the import command as import can only be done from an XML file.
** Cons: The exported file might not be very user friendly to read in the xml file format and hence later referencing to the file after exporting can be a nightmare.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Include export to an `Excel` file too.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user and might come in handy especially when the user wants to print it or later read the contents in a user friendly format.
** Cons: Complex implementation there by giving rise to more boundary cases to consider.
// end::export[]

// tag::shortcut[]
=== Personalised Shortcut
==== Current Implementation

The personalised shortcut uses a `ShortcutDouble` to hold the shortcut word and the command word. There is a `UniqueShortcutDoublesList` to which these `ShortcutDoubles` are added. The comparator in the `ShortcutDouble` accounts to check for any duplicates in the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList`. This list is then added to the `addressbook.xml` so as to load the shortcuts on initialisation. Below is a short code snippet of the constructor of the ShortcutDouble:

[source,java]
----
public ShortcutDoubles(String shortcutWord, String commandWord) {
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
}
----

This ShortcutDouble is called using the `ShortcutCommand`. Below is the constructor to the ShortcutCommand:
[source,java]
----
public ShortcutCommand(String commandWord, String shortcutWord) {
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
}
----

Shortcut command extends `UndoableCommand` and hence is undoable. It initially calls a filtered commandsList to which a new `ShortcutDouble` is added based on the checks. Below is the implementation of the `executeUndoableCommand()` method in the ShortcutCommand class.
[source,java]
----
commandsList = model.getFilteredCommandsList();
        checks for checking if the command is already present...

        ShortcutDoubles toAdd = new ShortcutDoubles(shortcutWord, commandWord);
        try {
            model.addCommandShortcut(toAdd);
        } catch (UniqueShortcutDoublesList.DuplicateShortcutDoublesException e) {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SHORTCUT_AVAILABLE));
        }

        returns the success message....
----

There is a check to find if the command is already present and the method used for this is called `checkIfCommandPresent()`.By default it returns false. Below is a small code snippet to take notice of:
[source,java]
----
if (!containsKeyWord(commandWord) || containsKeyWord(shortcutWord)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NO_COMMAND_TO_MAP);
}
for (ShortcutDoubles s : commandsList) {
     if (s.shortcutWord.equals(shortcutWord)) {
         return true;
     }
}
return false;
----

You can also choose to list all the shortcuts created uptil now. This displays the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList` instead of the contacts in the list panel. A high level sequence diagram is given below :

image::ListShortcutsHighLevelSequenceDiagrams.png[width="600"]



As of now the conditions to take note of are:
* Shortcut can be only one word.
* The command word should already exist.
* New commands are to be added in the `commandsPresent` String array.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Shortcut Command
* **Alternative 1:** Restricting the number of aliases of a command word.
** Pros: Allows for setting up a shortcut word there by increasing the usability of the app.
** Cons: Wouldn't help much if the user keeps forgetting the shortcut word too because there is only one shortcut alias and the user might forget it.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allowing multiple number of shortcut words for a single command word
** Pros: User can create multiple aliases there by giving the user more personalisation and the flexibility of forgetting the words as he can create more of them.
** Cons: Need to consider several cases for duplicate shortcuts and maintain a dynamic list without forgetting the shortcuts when the app is closed without hardcoding the shortcut word into each command.
// end::shortcut[]

// tag::deleteshortcut[]
=== Deleting Personalised Shortcut
==== Current Implementation
The personalised shortcut uses a `ShortcutDouble` to hold the shortcut word and the command word. There is a `UniqueShortcutDoublesList` to which these `ShortcutDoubles` are added. The comparator in the `ShortcutDouble` accounts to check for any duplicates in the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList`. This list is then added to the `addressbook.xml` so as to load the shortcuts on initialisation. Below is a short code snippet of the constructor of the ShortcutDouble:

[source,java]
----
public ShortcutDoubles(String shortcutWord, String commandWord) {
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
}
----

This ShortcutDouble can be deleted using the `DeleteShortcutCommand`. The sequence diagram is below :

image::DeleteShortcutSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]

Below is the constructor to the DeleteShortcutCommand:
[source,java]
----
public DeleteShortcutCommand(String commandWord, String shortcutWord) {
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        commandShortcut = new ShortcutDoubles(shortcutWord, commandWord);
}
----

DeleteShortcut command extends `UndoableCommand` and hence is undoable. It calls the method `deleteCommandShortcut()` in the model class to achieve its objective. Below is a code snippet of the `executeUndoableCommand()` used to for deleting the shortcut:
[source,java]
----
       try {
            model.deleteCommandShortcut(commandShortcut);
        } catch (UniqueShortcutDoublesList.CommandShortcutNotFoundException csnf) {
            throw new CommandException("Please enter a valid Shortcut Command you have saved");
        }
        returns the success message....
----

There is a check to find if the shortcut is already present or not and `CommandShortcutNotFoundException` is thrown if the shortcut is not present.

As of now the conditions to take note of are:
* DeleteShortcut can be only delete something if the command is already present.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Validity of the Delete Shortcut Command
* **Alternative 1:** Omit the delete shortcut command.
** Pros: Would require less implementation considering the fact that the shortcut has been added by the user.
** Cons: Would not give the user any room for mistake or change of mind as once added cannot be deleted.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Include the delete shortcut command.
** Pros: Will give the user the room to make mistake and change the shortcuts if needed. Would also help him in clearing the clutter of shortcuts which would have developed over time.
** Cons: Will have to take care of various edge cases when the shortcuts are not present and keep modifying the dynamic list. Several relevant exceptions have to be thrown and taken care of.

=== [Incomplete] Student Management
==== Current Implementation

The student manangement allows the user of TeachConnect to manage a particular type of contact, a student. The user is capable of interacting with the student contact just like with any other contact, for example: adding, editing, deleting and so on. In addition, users will be able to form classes to group students of the same class together. An overview of the Model Class after implementation is shown below:

image::EditedModelClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

As shown above, `student` extends from `person`, giving `student` access to its constructor and getter methods for `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address` whereas only `student` will have access to `class`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation of student

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** student extends person
** Pros: Allow students access to person methods while restricting person from accessing student methods.
** Cons: A separate UniqueStudentList is required to store the student contacts.
* **Alternative 2:** only use a tag to show its a student
** Pros: Simpler to implement and tags are visible to user
** Cons: Requires every operation to check the tags. Tags can be removed.
// end::studentmanagement[]

// tag::eventmanagement[]

=== Event Management
==== Current Implementation
There are two types of events: an `Appointment` or a `Task`.
The model for event are shown below:

image::EventModelClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

`Appointment` consist of 4 variables:

* Title: Hold description for the appointment
* Start Time: Hold the starting time of the appointment
* End time: Hold the end time of the appointment
* Person to meet: (optional) Hold the target  in the appointment

`Task` consist of 2 variables:

* Title: Hold description for the task
* Time: Hold the time the task is expected to be finished

*Commands supported for each event*

* Set
* Remove
* Edit

Similar to `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTagList`, `UniqueEventList` is linked
to `AddressBook`. Request to change to the `AddressBook` model is signalled through `ModelManager`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation of set event
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** user can still set appointment/task with the starting time/deadline already elapsed.
** Pros: Might be useful if the users want to keep track of past events.
** Cons: Not the most intuitive implementation and might be prone to error from the user side.
* **Alternative 2:** user can only set  appointment/task with the starting time/deadline in the future
** Pros: Is the more intuitive approach and can prevent the user from keying in "redundant" events
** Cons: As TeachConnect fetches the current time from the user's system, if the user for some purposes set the system's time to deviate from world clock, some difficulties may arise when he/she wants to add new event.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, TeachConnect depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in TeachConnect, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in TeachConnect.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever TeachConnect is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving TeachConnect to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves TeachConnect after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for TeachConnect storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that TeachConnect can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `TeachConnect`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

*Feature Contribution*

1. Mukesh Gadupudi

** Major Feature : Sharing of Contacts

*** Contacts can be imported or exported
*** They can be exported based on the tag or index
*** Import can be done given the file path of an XML file

** Minor Feature : Email contacts

*** Contacts can be emailed by either by tag or an individual contact.

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: This feature can help teachers share contacts with other teachers. This is especially useful when teachers change classes or pass on the class to other teachers. Updating and losing data is also a common problem and to overcome this a backup can be stored by using this feature.

*** Minor Feature: This feature can help teachers email contacts. This might be really helpful when the teacher wants to remind parents with appointments or remind students with the work they need to finish. This also helps the teachers send group messages to class or parents regarding some important announcements.

2. Rachel Ngo Phuong Thao
** Major Feature : Managing Appointments & Tasks

*** Users can add, edit, and remove appointments & tasks in TeachConnect
*** The appointments & tasks would be rendered in a calendar in the GUI
** Minor Feature : Changing the GUI theme

*** Users can set the theme of the GUI to dark theme or light theme

** How the features fit into the product scope :

3. Jonathan

** Major Feature : Data Encryption
*** Encrypts the data for increased safety

** Minor Feature : Sort Contacts

*** Contacts can be sorted in alphabetical order of the name/tag or the phone number of the contacts.

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: Since TeachConnect has a lot of personal details of students and parents, the owner of the address book would want to encrypt the application data file to prevent outside access to sensitive information.

*** Minor Feature: This helps teacher relate and understand the index of the contacts in the TeachConnect better. Indexing becomes easy when they later want to export or set appointments.

4. Randy Pang Pang

** Major Feature : Management of student contacts
*** Student contact can be created and be added into classes

** Minor Feature : Multiple tabs for the list in GUI
*** The list in GUI will hava tabs for multiple different lists
