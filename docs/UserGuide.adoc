== Introduction

TeachConnect (TC) is created to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. TeachConnect is also tailored for teachers who would *prefer to use a Desktop App for managing contacts*. Most importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to enter input using keyboard while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.

+
.  Download the latest `Teachconnect.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TeachConnect.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

Alternatively you can choose to export all the classes with the students in them. By specifying the type of the export you want it saves either only the xml file or the Csv file.

Format: `export n/NAME r/RANGE [t/TAG] p/PATH te/TYPE`

Format: `export classes n/NAME p/PATH te/TYPE`

****
* Here TYPE refers to the kind of export you want to do.
* `TYPE` can be either excel or xml.
****

[TIP]
You can export all the people at once, all the people with a certain tag at once, all the people with a certain tag in a range at once or all the people in a range with any tags in a single command. +
You can also choose to export it in Csv format which you can later open in Excel. +
You can also choose to export all the classes and the students in it using the export class format.

[WARNING]
You can only export all or people based on one or zero tags. +
Be careful about the parameter value for the format type. It has to exactly be either `xml` or `excel`.
