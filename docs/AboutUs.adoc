TeachConnect was developed by a team of students, with assistance from the Project Supervisor, as a project
for the module CS2103T.

It was built upon the AddressBook - Level 4 project developed by the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu]
team.

We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
